This is a database for me to catalog my books that are floating around my house in various locations, causing me to often forget what I actually own. 

This collection could be used to catalog all of my books so when I am purchasing books I can double check if the book is in my collection, or more specifically the isbn if I’m trying to collect multiple editions of the book. It could also be used to parse my collection and find a book either via the author, publisher or genre, or year if I’m looking for something specific to read. 

Out of the entity’s its pulls into the main data base, the main ones to help sort are the author_id, genre_id, and isbn. These help narrow down a way to sort and double check the data when I’m looking for a specific title, genre, or double checking if I were at the store that I’m getting a different edition of the book
