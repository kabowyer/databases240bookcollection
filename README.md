This collection could be used to catalog all of my books so when I am purchasing books I can double check if the book is in my collection, or more specifically the isbn if I’m trying to collect multiple editions of the book. It could also be used to parse my collection and find a book either via the author, publisher or genre, or year if I’m looking for something specific to read.
